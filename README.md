# PickDT
Xojo Simple DatePicker - very simple datepicker, tested on Mac OS and Windows. 
Technics and idea are from Andreas Vogt http://www.accessblog.de/?s=Datepicker.

Made with Xojo Desktop for Windows. Source is documented in german.

Details:

- Containercontrol with no use of external libs or graphics
- easy to change
- in english and german
- no AM/PM-mode, for now it is just for 24 hours
- week can start on monday and on sunday (set PickDT.weekstartsonmonday = False)
- date and time textfields are readonly
- works (as it is) in modal mode (Window.ShowModal)
- you have to put it into a window, to open it in a non modal state
- it's free, but pretty nice ;)
